            <p>Gusaba, which means "to ask" in Kirundi, is an age-old custom where the groom-to-be, along with his family or representatives, formally requests the hand of the bride from her family. This ceremony is not merely a formality but a crucial ritual that emphasizes respect, honor, and the bonds between families. <br> <br>

The ritual usually involves a series of conversations, often preceded by a formal meeting, where the groom’s family presents gifts or livestock as a token of goodwill. These symbolic offerings serve as a demonstration of the groom's seriousness and willingness to provide for his future wife. <br> <br>

The act of gusaba is accompanied by songs, dances, and a celebratory atmosphere. It is a moment when families unite, affirming their mutual respect and commitment to the upcoming marriage. Elders play a vital role, providing wisdom and guidance throughout the process. The ceremony is also seen as an opportunity to address family expectations and ensure that both parties are aligned in their understanding of the marriage. <br> <br>

However, Gusaba is more than just a marriage proposal. It is a cultural cornerstone that teaches the importance of patience, respect for elders, and the sanctity of family ties. For many Burundians, it remains an unbroken tradition passed down through generations. <br> <br>


While modern influences continue to reshape aspects of Burundian society, the custom of gusaba endures, remaining an essential expression of love, respect, and community. For Burundians both at home and abroad, it remains a cherished tradition that marks the beginning of lifelong commitments and the strengthening of familial bonds.</p>

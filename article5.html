            <h1>Burundian Culture: Respected, Then Forgotten </h1>
            <p> Burundian culture is respected both by Burundians themselves and by the wider world. However, its reliance on oral tradition makes it difficult to compete with other cultures that are enriched by their ancient written forms. This is why Burundian culture is gradually being forgotten, despite the tireless efforts of the traditionalist youth who fight daily to revive this rich cultural identity.</p>

            <p>Burundian culture is abundant. The content shared in poetry (such as ibicuba and amazina) and prose (like ibitito and imigani) forms the foundation of a harmonious, peaceful, and industrious society. Its main characteristic—and its wealth—lies in its diversity. The traditional regions of Burundi boast as many cultural variations as there are regions. For example, the different dances found across Burundi are distinct to each region. Moreover, the classification of cultural practices according to the gender of the participants adds to its richness. Historically, there were cultural practices unique to women and others specific to men, not as a sign of inequality but as a form of enriching diversity. <br> <br>

Burundians Are Proud of Their Culture <br> <br>

Ask any Burundian, and most will tell you that their culture is the best in the world. Like any devotee of a culture, they are proud of their heritage. They love the dance, music, inanga (zither), and other poetic expressions embedded in their culture. Furthermore, the moral lessons conveyed in ibitito and folktales remain central to the life of every Burundian.  <br> <br>

Both tangible and intangible cultural heritage remains a source of pride for Burundi. The Burundian drum, for example, has gained worldwide acclaim. Its inclusion in UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list was no surprise. Other cultural practices, particularly traditional dance and attire, also command respect from those who encounter them. <br> <br>

Rich in Values, Poor in Preservation  <br> <br>

While Burundians sing the praises of their culture, they have neglected to preserve it. They have failed to understand that culture is like tea—it requires daily care. It needs to be weeded, pruned, and nurtured. With colonization, the oral nature of Burundian culture enabled the proliferation of European culture at the expense of Burundian traditions. The elite educated by colonizers did not succeed in preserving their culture or, at the very least, in understanding the new culture through the lens of their own.  <br> <br>

This has greatly contributed to its decline. Apart from sculpture, basketry, and architecture, which can endure for years, other cultural forms are susceptible to being forgotten because oral memorization is unreliable. Without a tradition of writing, Burundian culture has suffered, as its ephemeral aspects are easily lost. Furthermore, Burundian literary creations are rare, leading to the neglect and disappearance of its cultural heritage. <br> <br>

The hope for Burundian culture lies in the conservative youth who frequently organize themselves into cultural clubs with traditionalist aims, creating traditional performances and songs. While modern troupes draw inspiration primarily from Western cultures, these traditionalist groups strive to blend the two, forming a hybrid between Western and Burundian cultures.</p>

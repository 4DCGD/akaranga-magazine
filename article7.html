            <p> What if art held the "ultimate" power to unite groups that were once torn apart? This is the question Ninziza Mika pondered.</p>

            <p>In Burundi, a young singer began to win the hearts of Burundians: Kidumu. One song in particular, Yaramenje, stood out. With lyrics calling for reconciliation and unity, Yaramenje became the anthem of reconciliation for a people who had endured more than 10 years of civil war. At the time, the President of the Republic, Pierre Buyoya, even invited Kidumu to perform several concerts to ease tensions among Burundians. "Yaramenje is undoubtedly one of the most important songs in the history of Burundi," said a young sociology student. But it’s not just music that has the power to profoundly touch souls. <br> <br>  

Art as a Vector for Reconciliation? <br> <br>

Irumva Ingress, a Burundian comedian, dancer-choreographer, director, and playwright, believes that “art can help unite two groups that were in conflict. However, it can also be the root of 'evil.' For instance, in Rwanda, songs filled with hatred were composed and used as propaganda leading to genocide. Later, songs like Never Again were created to transmit messages of love and unity—not to mention the theatrical performances that followed in the same vein.”  <br> <br>

Bayubahe Ely shares a similar view as Irumva Ingress. However, this playwright goes further, stating that art is "an easy way to reach people’s hearts." He adds, "Art is a tool that triggers dialogue about the past. It creates discussions in a space that is more accessible and human."  <br> <br>

As for young actress Keza Quentine, she believes that as long as art reaches out to the groups in conflict (or those who have been in conflict), it can contribute to their reconciliation. “Art must target these groups and know how to approach the conflict. For example, in theater, there is psychodrama, which is therapeutic theater. This is a tool that allows us to address themes that lead to the reconciliation of two conflicting groups.”</p>

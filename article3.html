            <h1>Climate Crisis in Burundi: Thousands of Children Displaced by Floods</h1>
            <img src="c.jpg" alt="Floods in Burundi" class="featured-image">
            <p>Since October 2023, East Africa has once again been ravaged by the El Niño climate phenomenon.</p>
            <p>Burundi, located at the borders of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Tanzania, is among the hardest-hit countries. Torrential rains, floods, and landslides have increased in recent months.</p>
            <p>Floodwaters have engulfed entire villages, destroyed thousands of homes, and displaced nearly 100,000 people.</p>
            <p>In total, more than 230,000 people have been affected by these climate shocks and are in urgent need of humanitarian aid.</p>
            <h2>Burundi Grapples with an Escalating Climate Crisis</h2>
            <p>At the heart of the Great Lakes region, Burundi known as one of the poorest countries in the world is also one of the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.</p>
            <p>Since January 2024, due to relentless heavy rains, the waters of Lake Tanganyika, Africa's second-largest lake, have been rising by 10 cm each week.</p>
            <p>For the local population, the nightmare seems to be repeating itself: their homes, schools, and markets are once again submerged.</p>
            <p>In the town of Gatumba, for example, located in the west of the country, the 2021-2022 floods had already caused significant damage. Now, two years later, Gatumba is facing the same tragic situation.</p>
            <h2>Agriculture Devastated, Livelihoods Lost</h2>
            <p>In Burundi, where agriculture is one of the main sources of income, the floods have destroyed nearly 40,000 hectares of crops—about 10% of the country's harvest.</p>
            <p>This means families have lost their primary means of survival and are living in complete destitution. For thousands who have been forced to flee, living conditions are dire.</p>
            <p>Without clean water, adequate sanitation, or access to essential healthcare, children are particularly vulnerable to disease outbreaks such as measles and cholera, as well as the deadly risks of dehydration.</p>
            <p>For instance, the cholera epidemic declared in January 2023 is still ongoing. So far, more than 1,500 cases have been recorded—a number that could skyrocket due to the floods.</p>

            <p>These drums were inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2014 and are central to Burundi's identity and history. <br> <br>

The Ingoma drums, traditionally crafted from hollowed-out tree trunks and animal hides, are more than just musical instruments in Burundian culture. Historically, they were used to announce royal decrees, celebrate victories and commemorate important events. Presently, they are symbols of national pride and are performed in cultural ceremonies, festivals and on the international stages. <br> <br>

Drumming is performed by specialized groups,who display extraordinary skill and stamina.Each performance blends rhythmic precision with acrobatics and storytelling, captivating local and international audiences. <br> <br>

“Ingoma is the heartbeat of Burundi.It unites us and connects us to our ancestors,” said Jean-Claude Niyonzima, a master drummer based in Gitega, the country’s capital. <br> <br>


Despite its cultural significance, efforts are underway to preserve the Ingoma tradition amid modern influences and challenges. Organizations in Burundi are collaborating with international partners to ensure younger generations learn the art of drumming and appreciate its cultural value. <br> <br>

In December, Burundi hosted the Festival des Tambours Royaux, drawing thousands of tourists and drummers from across Africa and beyond. The event highlighted the cultural richness of Ingoma while advocating for its preservation. <br> <br>

As Burundi advances on the global stage, its royal drums stand as a powerful reminder of the nation’s rich heritage and its determination to share it with the world.</p>

             <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Due to the influence of modernization, traditional Burundian dances are being completely forgotten, making way for Western dances. To address this issue, strategies must &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be implemented to preserve our traditional dances, which are the essence of the country's identity.</p>

            <p>Traditional dances are one of the key elements that significantly contribute to the preservation of Burundian tradition. By performing these dances, we relive the moments our ancestors experienced. This is done with appropriate attire and songs. Generally speaking, dance is a form of emotional expression. The gestures and movements of the body or specific parts of it reflect a reality unique to a country, a people, or a specific tribe. For example, in some traditional Burundian dances, the movements of the arms may symbolize the elegance of cattle horns as they walk in herds, the gesture of a farmer lifting their hoe, a fisherman handling their paddle, or a hunter brandishing their spear. <br> <br>

A Choreography, a Message<br> <br>
Often, the dancerâ€™s message becomes clearer through the words of the accompanying song. These songs and dances are tailored to specific occasions, given their functions. For instance, there are specific dances for wedding ceremonies. However, over time, some dances have lost their meaning and remain merely folkloric performances intended for social entertainment. <br> <br>

Muco (a pseudonym), a young dancer from a club in Bujumbura, stated that today's traditional dance has become more of a business. All the clubs practicing it aim to showcase themselves, gain recognition, and seek profit without considering cultural preservation. He also pointed out that even the attire used today does not directly reflect Burundian tradition, as most clubs dress to look appealing in front of their competitors (other clubs). <br> <br>

A National Heritage <br> <br>
Based on the definition of tradition as a treasure trove of knowledge, theories, and practices passed down from generation to generation, it becomes evident that traditional dances make a significant contribution to the preservation of Burundian tradition. Indeed, traditional dances are not merely about dancing and singing traditional songs but also about understanding the types of dances, their origins, and the ceremonies or situations in which they were performed. In this way, one gains extensive knowledge about our cherished tradition, which can help to reinforce it. <br> <br>

Therefore, while traditional dances may not fully reflect the tradition itself, they remain of vital importance because they provide a glimpse into how this marvelous ancient tradition once was.</p>

            <h1>Burundi Launches National Adaptation Plan Project to Combat Climate Change</h1>
            <img src="a.jpg" alt="Burundi landscape" class="featured-image">
            <p>On April 10, 2025, Burundi launched the project for the development and implementation of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process, marking a new milestone in the fight against the effects of climate change.</p>
            <p>Funded by the Green Climate Fund to the tune of USD 2,431,753 (equivalent to BIF 7,183,398,362), this project came to life through a partnership between the Ministry of Environment and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p>
            <p>The objective of the project is to provide the country with a strategic tool to plan adaptation actions to the impacts of climate change and enhance its capacity to mobilize funding from international donors and bilateral partners.</p>
            <p>Several outcomes are expected from this 36-month project. First, it aims to strengthen planning, governance, and institutional coordination in the area of adaptation. Secondly, the project seeks to develop an evidence-based database to design locally relevant solutions. Other key priorities include engaging the private sector in adaptation and increasing climate finance.</p>
            <p>Mathieu Ciowela, UNDP Resident Representative in Burundi, emphasized the importance of this initiative, stating that the project will enable Burundi to establish an investment planning tool through the National Adaptation Plan to prevent and respond to the harmful effects of climate change.</p>
            <p>Climate change is primarily attributed to human activities. It causes major weather disturbances: rising temperatures, intense rainfall leading to floods and landslides, soil erosion, loss of agricultural fertility, and destruction of ecosystems. It also forces populations to migrate and poses a threat to public health. The UNDP representative issued a warning, stressing that if no action is taken, climate change will affect human capital, hinder a country's socio-economic development, and undermine social cohesion.</p>
            <p>Faced with this global threat, the response lies in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting adaptation and mitigation measures. The Paris Agreement adopted at COP21 was a turning point in this direction. The NAP project aligns with this dynamic and is intended to be a strategic lever for Burundi. It is aligned with the national program for the Green Climate Fund (2024–2027) and the climate finance framework (2023–2030). The project aims to equip the Burundian government with a planning tool to anticipate and cope with the adverse effects of climate change, as highlighted by Mathieu.</p>
            <p>Through its initiatives, UNDP pledges to continue supporting the Burundian government's efforts to strengthen the country's resilience to climate challenges. "We are committed to supporting Burundi in implementing its national development plans in line with the country's vision of becoming an emerging nation by 2040 and a developed country by 2060," reiterated the UNDP Resident Representative.</p>
            <p>Burundi is facing increasingly frequent climate disturbances, with direct consequences on infrastructure, the economy, and public health. According to Christian Nimubona, Director General of Environment, Agro-Food Resources and Sanitation at the Ministry of Environment, Agriculture, and Livestock, the challenges include droughts, delayed or early rains, heavy precipitation, and surface erosion, all of which weaken the economy and rural communities. This phenomenon also causes damage to public and private infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and schools.</p>
            <p>The plan will thus make it possible to precisely identify climate risks and structure the national response by facilitating the development of adaptation projects and collecting essential data on the impacts of climate change. It will also help the country increase its capacity to mobilize funding from donors.</p>
            <p>Emmanuel Ndorimana, Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Environment, stated during the project's launch workshop that the workshop is essential to the project's success, as it will allow participants to gain a shared understanding of the involvement of public and private institutions in the development of the National Adaptation Plan, in line with the government's climate change priorities and vision.</p>
            <p>During the workshop, participants had the opportunity to discuss crucial points to ensure the project's success. They also issued recommendations aimed at increasing the involvement of universities and research centers to provide scientific and technical expertise. Furthermore, clarifying the roles of the various stakeholders and involving relevant ministries were deemed essential for effective implementation. A recurring question was raised regarding Burundi's direct access to Green Climate Fund financing. Conducting preliminary studies to better document the country's needs and priorities was also given significant attention.</p>

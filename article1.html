            <p> <em></p>Gitega National Museum: A Vanishing Treasure?</em>, are a treasure trove of wisdom and cultural insight. These proverbs are often used in everyday conversations to convey deep meanings and life lessons. Below are some examples of popular Burundian proverbs and their interpretations:</p>

            <p>From the cobbled street, the building bears the inscription "Musée National de Gitega" The building appears modest and ungrand .
A small, partly landscaped garden adorns the entrance Visitors pass through a gate and a paved courtyard before entering the museum Admission fees are 5,000 BIF for local adults, 1,000 BIF for local children, 20,000 BIF for foreign adults, 5,000 BIF for foreign children and 2,000 BIF for local students Inside, visitors are greeted by words from Ernest Renan: "True progressives are those who have great respect for the past" The curator explains the museum's origins at the start of the tour. <br>

A Legacy of Belgian Colonization <br>

The Gitega National Museum was built under Belgian supervision in 1955, according to curator Jean Bosco Niyonzima Official records regarding the opening date are unclear It was then entrusted to King Mwambutsa IV Bangirichenge as a repository of ethnological and archaeological artifacts to preserve Burundi's cultural heritageThe museum should build a bridge between tradition and modernity and act as a centre for cultural education His ethnological collection includes items reflecting daily life in ancient Burundi, especially in the royal palace Exhibits include tools, musical instruments, hunting spears, traditional clothing made from bark and animal skins, amulets and a variety of vases Archaeological finds give insight into the customs and practices of ancient Burundi

A Journey Through Burundi’s Past

The museum features a single exhibition hall. A statue of a spear-wielding warrior stands at the entrance. “This was our Ministry of Defense,” jokes the curator, describing the warrior’s role in national battles. Inside, the first exhibit depicts the royal court, including a sculpture of the king served by eunuchs. Nearby, tools from traditional ironworking are displayed, showcasing Burundi’s metallurgical heritage.

Other exhibits include a royal bedroom with a woven mat-covered bed (ikirwa) and a guillotine (ingangura). Everyday items like clay pots (ivyansi), wooden cups (inkongoro), and traditional smoking pipes are meticulously preserved. Depictions of ancient practices, such as kubandwa (ancestral worship), gupfumura (ritual piercing), and guterekera (offering rituals), further illustrate Burundian traditions.

At the hall’s center stands amaceri, the royal sedan chair, humorously referred to by the curator as the king’s “V8.” Display cases hold colonial-era currencies and other archaeological finds. The miniature portrait of a drummer completes the cultural narrative. Despite the wealth of heritage on display, the museum shows signs of neglect. 


Cultural Heritage at Risk 

According to curator Niyonzima, the museum faces numerous challenges "Very few Burundians visit the museum,  foreigners come to explore the country's history," he lamented, pointing to a lack of creativity and innovation in preserving traditional artefacts such as bark clothingThe museum suffers from financial constraints, with no its own budget or autonomy Revenues from entrance fees are paid directly to the central bank Public authorities have shown little interest and have rejected requests for assistance Even basic maintenance relies on a loyal partner Niyonzima plans to expand the museum by setting up a library and an IT centre for researchers Despite the difficulties, he is determined and is planning a press conference to raise awareness But without government intervention, the future of this cultural gem remains uncertain.</p>
